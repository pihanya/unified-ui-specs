# 🌐 Unified UI Specs v1

<img src="assets/banner.png" alt="Unified UI Specs banner" width="480" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; max-width:100%; height:auto;"/>

Unified UI Specs defines a machine-readable standard for screen and flow specifications that keeps product, design, and engineering teams aligned. The standard is grounded in ISO 9241 interaction principles, WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility, and the W3C Design Tokens Community Group format so that every artifact captures intent, interaction, and compliance in one place.

## ✨ Why it exists

- Replace brittle handoff decks with deterministic specs that map directly to implementation.
- Bake accessibility, i18n, analytics, and QA requirements into the same artifact.
- Validate design intent automatically using the bundled JSON Schema and example spec.

## 🔗 Quick references

- Full standard text — [`knowledge/unified-ui-specs-standard.md`](knowledge/unified-ui-specs-standard.md)
- Example structured screen spec — [`Section 2`](knowledge/unified-ui-specs-standard.md#2-example-screen-spec) inside the standard document
- JSON representation — [`knowledge/unified-ui-specs-example.json`](knowledge/unified-ui-specs-example.json)
- Human-readable walkthrough — [`knowledge/unified-ui-specs-human-example.md`](knowledge/unified-ui-specs-human-example.md)

- `knowledge/unified-ui-specs-schema.json` — JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) enforcing the standard for machine validation.
- [`knowledge/unified-ui-specs-example.json`](knowledge/unified-ui-specs-example.json) — Reference implementation of a compliant screen spec.
- [`knowledge/unified-ui-specs-human-example.md`](knowledge/unified-ui-specs-human-example.md) — Human-readable walk-through of the sample spec.
- `docs/article/` — Practitioner-friendly articles ([🇺🇸 English](docs/article/unified-ui-specs-article-en_US.md), [🇷🇺 Russian](docs/article/unified-ui-specs-article-ru_RU.md)).
- `docs/paper/` — Extended research papers ([🇺🇸 English](docs/paper/unified-ui-specs-paper-en_US.md), [🇷🇺 Russian](docs/paper/unified-ui-specs-paper-ru_RU.md)).
- `docs/pdf/` — Exported PDF versions suitable for circulation.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Read the standard** — Start with `knowledge/unified-ui-specs-standard.md` to understand the required sections and terminology.
2. **Clone the example** — Copy `knowledge/unified-ui-specs-example.json` as a template for new screens. Keep the section ordering and schema keys.
3. **Reference design tokens** — Define tokens inline or link to an external DTCG-compliant store via the `design_tokens` block.
4. **Validate continuously** — Use your preferred JSON Schema validator (e.g. `ajv`, `jsonschema`, or IDE tooling) against `knowledge/unified-ui-specs-schema.json` to catch missing fields before handoff.
5. **Bundle supporting artifacts** — Link Figma files, Jira tickets, PRDs, personas, requirements, and test cases through the `artifact_card.links` object so the spec stays the single source of truth.

## 🛠️ Authoring checklist

- Artifact metadata tracks owners, semantic version, status, supported platforms, and citations.
- Composition describes regions, focus order, and design system components only—no ad-hoc widgets.
- States, behaviors, and interactions cover every input method (touch, keyboard, voice) with analytics hooks.
- Accessibility targets meet or exceed WCAG 2.2 AA (contrast, focus, touch targets) and provide alternatives for gestures.
- Internationalization includes ICU message keys, tone guidance, RTL readiness, and expansion budgets.
- Edge cases, BDD acceptance criteria, data contracts, and analytics plans are explicit and testable.

## 🧭 Workflow example

```bash
# 1. Draft or update your spec JSON
code knowledge/my-screen-spec.json

# 2. Run validation (example using ajv-cli)
ajv validate \
  --spec=draft2020 \
  -s knowledge/unified-ui-specs-schema.json \
  -d knowledge/my-screen-spec.json

# 3. Share with product/design/engineering for review or attach to Jira.
```

## 🌱 Extending the standard

- Propose changes in `knowledge/unified-ui-specs-standard.md` and mirror required updates in the schema and example.
- Keep semantic versioning on both the specification artifact and the schema itself.
- Add localized articles or PDFs inside `docs/` and `docs/pdf/` as needed; keep filenames language-tagged (e.g. `en_US`, `ru_RU`).
